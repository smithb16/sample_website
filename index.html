    <h1>The Learn Enough Story</h1>
    <p>
      HTML was created by the original "web developer", computer scientist
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee">Tim Berners-Lee</a
      >. It's not true that Sir Tim invented HTML in order to share pictures of
      his cat, but it would be cool if it were.

    <h2>Quotations</h2>
    <p>
      In addition to hosting the world's supply of kitten videos, the Web is
      also full of inspiring quotes, perhaps none more than this one:
    </p>
    <blockquote style="padding: 2px 20px; background-color: #ccc;">
      <em>Don't believe every quote you read on the Internet.</em> <br />
      -Abraham Lincoln
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      Learn Enough to be Dangerous is an outgrowth of the
      <a href="railstutorial.org">Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and the
      <a href="softcover.io">Softcover publishing platform</a>. This page is
      part of the sample site for
      <a href="learnenough.com/html"
        ><em>Learn Enough HTML to Be Dangerous</em></a
      >, which teaches the basics of <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext
      <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, the universal language
      of the World Wide Web. Other related tutorials can be found at
      <a href="www.learnenough.com">learnenough.com</a>

    <h3>Michael Hartl</h3>

    <p>
      Michael is the creator of the
      <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org/"> Ruby on Rails Tutorial</a> and
      principal author of the
      <a href="https://www.learnenough.com/">Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a>
      introductory sequence. He is an advanced student of
      <a href="https://www.kravmaga.com/">Krav Maga</a> and has a three-step
      plan for world domination. Rumors that he's secretly a supervillain are
      slightly exaggerated.

    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>

    <p>
      When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes on
      his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd at
      heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a tour
      bus as he is from his kitchen table.
